# Use Case

I'm bored and I need to relax...  
And as we are at it, how do I remember all those Docker commands? Any UI available?

# Exposed Tech
+ You can find just about anything in containers... even games :-)
+ Try out the Portainer portal


# Focus
+ Run the ```./containersCanBeFun.sh``` script and connect your browser to [localhost](http://localhost:8090)
+ Run the ```./containersMgmt.sh``` and point your browser to [Portainer](http://localhost:9000)
