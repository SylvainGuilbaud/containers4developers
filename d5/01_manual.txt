1)
Just like in a preceding exercise where we learnt that we can map a directory or a file,
we can use the same trick.
Here we map an executable to its internal (to the container) location
-v $PWD/iris.exe:/usr/irissys/bin/iris.exe

2)
We can of course just copy a file on top of the old one as in a traditional environment.
Here is the 'dockercp' command
docker cp iris.exe <container-id>:/usr/irissys/bin/iris.exe

3)
Run it, use it, push it & share it, discard it
$ docker run -d my-special.kit:0.1
$ curl http://localhost:8080
$ docker exec -it <container-id> bash
$ docker push <repo/container-image-name:ver>
$ docker rm -f my-special.kit:0.1
